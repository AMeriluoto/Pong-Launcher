# Pong-Launcher
This project is a ping pong ball launcher made using Legos and Arduino. It is designed for those yearning for play partners during a pandemic.

We decided upon the arm design after realizing the motors we had in our starting Arduino kit did not create enough torque for use as flywheels. 

Currently a work in progress.

Desired functionality:

With the addition of the Mode class, we hope to add buttons to the design that would allow the user to toggle between different Modes, such as a light-hitting mode, a mode where the launcher rotates to random angles, a mode in which the launcher oscillates, etc. 

Currently the launcher has one mode in which it retracts the arm all the way back and rotates to random angles before launching the ball.
